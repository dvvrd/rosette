; This module performs merging of Horn clauses for hardly solvable clauses.
; Demonstrating it below on the example with clauses for folds.
;
; It tries to solve the comparison of two folds of the same list in query.
; For example if we have query (< (fold + 0 xs) (fold + 0 (map add1 xs))) we have such
; clauses:
;
; (l = 0) => (fold1 acc xs acc)
; (l > 0) & (fold1 (+ acc h )  xs' eps) => (fold1 acc xs eps)
; and
; (l = 0) => (fold2 acc xs acc)
; (l > 0) & (fold2 (+ acc h 1) xs' eps) => (fold2 acc xs eps)
;
; The problem that when we instantiate fold1 and fold2 we get two universally quantified
; 'h' constants (so solver thinks that those are two different non-deterministic values).
; The only way to solve this problem is to generate 'product' fold clause that will
; describe synchronious folds calculation:
;
; (l = 0) => (fold acc1 acc2 xs acc1 acc2)
; (l > 0) & (fold (+ acc1 h) (+ acc2 h 1) xs' eps1 eps2) => (fold acc1 acc2 xs eps1 eps2)
;
; The merging process is performed via merge/folds procedure. It accepts a system of arbitrary
; Horn clauses, detects fold patterns, merges clauses defining them and replaces applications
; of merged folds with applications of product fold.
;
; Note that sometimes we can't merge folds depending one on other, for example such ones:
; (fold + (fold - 0 xs) xs). The system automaticly builds graph of fold dependencies and
; merges only independent folds.
